For our project, we worked with the Twitter api to access tweets from various searches and get trending topics from various locations. We accessed it using OAuth2 from a twitter account. Tweets contain a maximum of 140 characters and users can tweet about whatever they like. However, we can search specific terms or topics and look at all of the tweets and look at people’s thoughts and reactions on specific topics. 
Since our target audience is markerters, we want to provide relevant information specifically for marketing teams. One example that is that if a topic is trending in a specific city, the marketing team can focus their advertisements around that topic. This would help the team focus ads toward current events. Another example is that marketing teams could search a specific term, such as their product, and look at people’s reaction toward it. We want to provide tools that can condense the information from hundreds/thousands of tweets into an easy visualization. Finally, we want to make sure a potential marketer can see what top tweeters statistics are when it comes to followers and number of tweets.
