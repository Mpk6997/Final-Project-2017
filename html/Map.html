    This is a map with twitter data on 51 of the biggest cities in the United States.The size of the dots of cities is indexed by the population of the city. When you hover over a city, you can see the most tweeted words and hashtags for that given area. This can be extremely useful in finding out what is happening right now in a city. For example, when you hover over Denver on 5/31, you can see that the top trending tweet is about the phrase "I-25" - which is extremely relevant because the I-25 freeway in Denver is shut down today because of a large accident.
