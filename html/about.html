We want to provide relevant information specifically for marketing teams. One example that is that if a topic is trending in a specific city, the marketing team can focus their advertisements around that topic. This would help the team focus ads toward current events. Another example is that marketing teams could search a specific term, such as their product, and look at peopleâ€™s reaction toward it. We want to provide tools that can condense the information from hundreds/thousands of tweets into an easy visualization. Finally, we want to make sure a potential marketer can see what top tweeters statistics are when it comes to followers and number of tweets. 

The full group is Hugo Baldner, Ben Basinski, Chaitanya Gangavarapu, Ashish Sushil Israni, Matthew Klein
