   This is a wordcloud that represents some of the most tweeted words either by an account or about a specific account. If the select drop down menu is on the tab "Search," then the words in this wordcloud will represent the most tweeted words or phrases about that subject. For example, if "UW" is searched, at a given time the most commonly used phrase on twitter about uw would be "UW Football." The bigger a word/phrase is on this wordcloud means that it has been tweeted about more than the others.The second drop down option on "Select" is "User's Timeline." For the User's timeline tab, you can search any twitter handle (excluding the @), and create a wordcloud with their most commonly used words on twitter.
The third and final drop down option is "Trending." This tab lets you select from a large number of the most trending words and phrases on Twitter. A wordcloud is then generated from the most commonly used words and phrases about that specific trend.
In addition to these, there is a slider that can allow you to change the number of tweets you would like to use for the creation of the wordcloud. The further to the right you are on the slider means the more words that will be in your wordcloud.
This wordcloud has all of the same functionality as the previous wordcloud, and supports all of the dropdowns, search-bars, and sliders from the above wordcloud. The unique aspect of this wordcloud is that it splits up the words in tweets that have negative and positive connotations. The words on the top half of the wordcloud in red possess a negative connotation, and the words in the bottom half of the wordcloud in blue possess a positive connotation.
